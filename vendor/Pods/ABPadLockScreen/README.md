## Installation with Cocoapods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the easiest way to manage your iOS/OSX dependencies. Check out their getting started guide to see how to set it up.
If you have cocoapods setup on your machine, simply set the spec like this:

#### Podfile
```ruby
platform :ios, '6.0'
pod "ABPadLockScreen", "~> 3.1.0"
```
The earliest version of this framework that supports cocoapods is 3.0.0

## Customising the Appearance
The module is entirely customisable through UIAppearance. All colours and fonts used within the module can be set using the UIAppearance proxy. The example project shows how to do this, but for a more in depth look at UIAppearance check out the docs [check out the docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIAppearance_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html) or check out [Matt Thompsonâ€™s article on NSHipster](http://nshipster.com/uiappearance/)
